 A weather app that shows the forecast for the user’s current location or for an entered city name

Features: This app has multiple views and is organized using MVC. The view was designed using Autolayout and UIKit. I used Cocoapods to install Alamofire, which was used to simplify RESTful services when working with the Open Weather Map API. SwiftyJSON was used to simplify parsing the results of the API call. Core Location is used to get the user’s location in real-time. I used Swift protocols to pass data back to a previous view controller.
